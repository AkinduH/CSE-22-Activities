Problem: The Dining Philosophers Problem


Scenario: Five philosophers are seated at a round table, each with a plate of spaghetti in front of 
them. There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. To eat, a philosopher needs to use 
two forks: one from their left and one from their right.


Task: Implement a solution to the Dining Philosophers problem using mutual exclusion to prevent 
deadlock and starvation.
