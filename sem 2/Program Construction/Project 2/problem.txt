You are required to test the performance of several Java Collection implementations for a few methods.

The list of Java Collection implementations are:

HashSet
TreeSet
LinkedHashSet
ArrayList
LinkedList
ArrayDeque
PriorityQueue
HashMap
TreeMap
LinkedHashMap
The list of methods for performance checking are:

"add" a given element to the collection
check if a collection "contains" a given element
"remove" a given element from the collection (if it is present)
"clear" all the elements in the collection
Follow the guidelines below when constructing your program:

Perform the tests using default initialCapacity and loadFactor values.
When testing, first each collection must be loaded with 100,000 items.
The items to be loaded are Integer objects.
Each Integer object must be of a random value between 0 and 99,999 (inclusive).
The time measurements must be obtained at nanoseconds.
Run each test 100 times and get the average value as the result.
You are required to submit a report in PDF format with a cover page and 4 sections containing

A brief and concise description of your program design
Full Java program code used for testing
A comparison table of performance data
Brief descriptive discussions on the reasons for performance variations
